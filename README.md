# Gauss-Jordan Elimination

This is a simple implementation of Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm.
The code gets a system of linear equations as an augmented matrix and returns the answers in ascending order. It also calculates the inverse of the coefficent matrix with that same Gauss-Jordan algorithm.

input 1:
```
3
-2 -4 -10 0
9 0 -5 -58
5 -6 -3 -68
```
output 1
```

[[-0.05  0.08  0.03]
 [ 0.    0.09 -0.17]
 [-0.09 -0.05  0.06]]
